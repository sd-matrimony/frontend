        </ul>

        <h3>2. How to Cancel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To request a cancellation, the member must <strong className="font-semibold">contact our Admin/Support team directly</strong> through the official communication channels provided on our website (Contact Us page).</li>
          <li>The request must clearly include the registered email ID, mobile number, and payment details for verification.</li>

        <h3>4. Non-Refundable Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Membership fees are <strong className="font-semibold">non-refundable</strong> once services (such as profile viewing, messaging, or other premium features) have been used, even if it falls within the same day.</li>
